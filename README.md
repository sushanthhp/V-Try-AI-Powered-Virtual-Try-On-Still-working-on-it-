V-Try: AI-Powered Virtual Try-OnA sophisticated web application that allows users to virtually try on clothing from any source using a photo of themselves. This project leverages a powerful Python backend for AI-driven image processing and a sleek, modern React frontend for a seamless user experience.(This image is a representation of the final UI design)
‚ú® FeaturesRealistic Head Compositing: Swaps the user's entire head onto a model's body for a photorealistic result.Universal Clothing Sources: Supports default models, user-uploaded photos, and links from shopping websites.Advanced AI Pipeline: Employs a multi-stage AI process for highly accurate and seamless image generation.Modern Single-Page UI: A fast, responsive interface built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS in a "Neon Tech" theme.
ü§ñ How It WorksThe application's realism is achieved through a precise AI pipeline. It first creates a "headless" version of the clothing model by digitally removing the head using MediaPipe for pose and segmentation analysis. Simultaneously, it processes the user's photo, straightening the head and creating a perfect background-free cutout with rembg. Finally, OpenCV calculates the exact alignment and composites the user's head onto the model's body for a seamless virtual try-on.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackBackend: Python, Flask, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Rembg, ONNX RuntimeFrontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Babel
üöÄ Getting StartedTo get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.PrerequisitesPython 3.9+pip and venvInstallation & SetupClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/v-try-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/v-try-project.git)
