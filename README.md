<div align="center">V-Try: AI-Powered Virtual Try-On<p align="center">A sophisticated web application that allows users to virtually try on clothing from any source using a photo of themselves. This project leverages a powerful Python backend for AI-driven image processing and a sleek, modern React frontend for a seamless user experience.</p><p align="center"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9%252B-blue%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dpython" alt="Python"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-black%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dflask" alt="Flask"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/React-18-61DAFB%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dreact" alt="React"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenCV-5C3EE8%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dopencv" alt="OpenCV"><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://img.shields.io/badge/MediaPipe-00755D%3Fstyle%3Dfor-the-badge%26logo%3Dgoogle" alt="MediaPipe"></p></div><p align="center">(Replace this with a high-quality GIF or screenshot of your final application)<br><img src="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://i.imgur.com/K11g0bN.jpg" alt="V-Try Interface" width="700"></p>‚ú® FeaturesRealistic Head Compositing: Swaps the user's entire head onto a model's body for a photorealistic result.Universal Clothing Sources: Supports default models, user-uploaded photos, and links from shopping websites.Advanced AI Pipeline: Employs a multi-stage AI process for highly accurate and seamless image generation.Modern Single-Page UI: A fast, responsive interface built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS in a "Neon Tech" theme.ü§ñ How It WorksThe application's realism is achieved through a precise AI pipeline. It first creates a "headless" version of the clothing model by digitally removing the head using MediaPipe for pose and segmentation analysis. Simultaneously, it processes the user's photo, straightening the head and creating a perfect background-free cutout with rembg. Finally, OpenCV calculates the exact alignment and composites the user's head onto the model's body for a seamless virtual try-on.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackCategoryTechnologiesBackendPython, Flask, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Rembg, ONNX RuntimeFrontendReact, Tailwind CSS, BabelCore AI ModelsFace Mesh, Pose Estimation, Selfie SegmentationüöÄ Getting StartedTo get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.PrerequisitesPython 3.9+pip and venvInstallation & SetupClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/v-try-project.git](https://github.com/your-username/v-try-project.git)
