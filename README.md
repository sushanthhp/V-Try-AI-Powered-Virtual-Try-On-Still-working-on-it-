# V-Try-AI-Powered-Virtual-Try-On-Still-working-on-it-
A sophisticated web application that allows users to virtually try on clothing from any source using a photo of themselves. This project leverages a powerful Python backend for AI-driven image processing and a sleek, modern React frontend for a seamless user experience.
‚ú® Features
Realistic Head Compositing: Swaps the user's entire head onto a model's body for a photorealistic result.

Universal Clothing Sources: Supports default models, user-uploaded photos, and links from shopping websites.

Advanced AI Pipeline: Employs a multi-stage AI process for highly accurate and seamless image generation.

Modern Single-Page UI: A fast, responsive interface built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS in a "Neon Tech" theme.

ü§ñ How It Works
The application's realism is achieved through a precise AI pipeline. It first creates a "headless" version of the clothing model by digitally removing the head using MediaPipe for pose and segmentation analysis. Simultaneously, it processes the user's photo, straightening the head and creating a perfect background-free cutout with rembg. Finally, OpenCV calculates the exact alignment and composites the user's head onto the model's body for a seamless virtual try-on.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Rembg, ONNX Runtime

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Babel
